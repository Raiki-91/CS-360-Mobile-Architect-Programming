### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app I developed was an event management application designed to help users efficiently organize and keep track of their events. The primary goal was to create a user-friendly interface that allowed users to add, edit, and delete events with ease, while also sending reminders via SMS. This app was designed to address the need for a simple yet effective tool for personal event management, allowing users to stay on top of their schedules without the complexity of more extensive calendar apps.

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
To support user needs, the app included essential screens such as the main event list, an event creation/edit screen, and a confirmation dialog for deleting events. The UI was designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, ensuring that users could easily navigate the app without confusion. For instance, the event creation screen prominently featured input fields for the event name, date, and time, with intuitive prompts to guide the user. The design was successful because it minimized the learning curve, making it accessible even to users who might not be tech-savvy.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I approached the coding process methodically, starting with the basic structure and gradually adding more complex features. One key strategy was to break down the development process into manageable tasks, such as implementing the event database, creating the UI, and adding SMS functionality. I also employed frequent testing after each significant change to ensure that new features integrated smoothly. This approach of incremental development and continuous testing can be applied to future projects to maintain code quality and reduce the likelihood of introducing bugs.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested the app by performing user experience testing ensureing that it was function from an end user prespective. This process is crucial as it not only verifies the correctness of the code but also ensures that the app meets user expectations. The testing revealed some initial usability issues, such as the keyboard appearing instead of the date and time picker, which were addressed to improve the user experience.

### Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
One significant challenge I faced was ensuring that the date and time input fields were intuitive and functional. Initially, users reported that the keyboard appeared instead of the expected date and time pickers, which disrupted the user experience. To overcome this, I had to innovate by modifying the UI components to trigger the appropriate pickers and by setting default values to streamline the event creation process. This innovation ensured that users could input dates and times more efficiently, enhancing the overall usability of the app.

### In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was particularly successful in implementing the SMS reminder feature. This component required a deep understanding of Android permissions, user notifications, and the SMS Manager API. Successfully integrating this feature demonstrated my ability to handle complex functionality while ensuring that the app remained user-friendly and secure. It also highlighted my capability to manage user permissions effectively, ensuring that the app only requested the necessary permissions to maintain user trust.
